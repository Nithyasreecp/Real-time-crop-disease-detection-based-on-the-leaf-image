A Lightweight CNN Model for Real-Time Crop Disease Detection Using MobileNet with Grad-CAM

Plant diseases diminish agricultural yield and put
food safety at risk. They also increase economic losses in agriculture. Early detection can reduce losses and improve outcomes.
Manual methods are time-consuming and require significant expertise. To address these barriers, this research proposes a model
that automatically detects diseases in plant leaves. For lightweight
and real-time detection, the model uses a Convolutional Neural
Network architecture, focusing on MobileNet. The research uses
the PlantVillage dataset, which includes images of both healthy
and diseased leaves. It covers bacterial spot, early blight, late
blight, and yellow leaf curl in pepper, tomato, and potato to
train the model. To improve accuracy and interpretability, the
model uses Explainable AI methods, including Grad-CAM, to
visually highlight affected areas in leaf images. The model offers
a solution for early crop disease detection, supporting farmers
in taking timely preventive actions and promoting sustainable
agricultural growth. Grad-CAM visualization improved explainability by showing diseased regions, helping users understand
each prediction. This transparency builds trust and encourages
the use of AI-powered solutions in agriculture. The combination
of efficiency, explainability, and real-time performance makes the
proposed model a strong and scalable solution for crop disease
monitoring. It provides farmers with accessible and reliable
technology for early detection and prevention in plant health
management.
